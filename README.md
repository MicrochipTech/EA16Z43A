# SAMA7G54 System-On-Modules Series
## Early Access Repository
The Microchip SAMA7G54 System-On-Module Series is a small double-sided SOM series based on a System-in-Package (SiP) Arm® Cortex®-A7 CPU-based embedded microprocessor running up to 1 GHz.
The SAMA7G54 SOM Series is built on a common set of proven Microchip components to reduce time to market by simplifying hardware design and software development.
The SOM embeds a SAMA7G5 Series SiP microprocessor with up to 2-Gbit DDR3L SDRAM, up to 4-Gbit NAND Flash memory, a 64-Mbit serial Quad I/O Flash memory and a dedicated Power Management Unit.
The SAMA7G54 SOM Series also limits design rules of the main application board, reducing overall PCB complexity and cost. The SAMA7G54 SOM Series is supported by a free Linux® distribution and bare metal C examples. 

## EA16Z43A - SAMA7G54 SOM EA Bundle
The EA16Z43A is a bundle of 3 pre-production Microchip SAMA7G54 System-On-Module products.  
These are small single-sided MPU SOMs based on a System-In-Package (SIP) Arm® Cortex®-A7 CPU-based embedded microprocessor with 2-Gbit DDR3L SDRAM integrated running up to 1 GHz.

## Assembly Limitations
It is not recommended to use industrial automated reflow process with oven to solder the product on the mother board, as the process might impact the System-On-Module reliability.

Work Around: Solder the System-On-Module on the mother board manually.
