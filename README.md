# EA16Z43A - SAMA7G54 SOM EA Bundle
Early Access repository for the SAMA7G54 System-On-Module products

The EA16Z43A is a bundle of 3 pre-production Microchip SAMA7G54 System-On-Module products.  
These are small single-sided MPU SOMs based on a System-In-Package (SIP) Arm® Cortex®-A7 CPU-based embedded microprocessor with 2-Gbit DDR3L SDRAM integrated running up to 1 GHz.
The SAMA7G54 SOM family is built on a common set of proven Microchip components to reduce time to market by simplifying hardware design and software development.  
In addition to the 2-Gbit DDR3L SAMA7G54 MPU SIP, the SOM embeds a 4-Gbit NAND Flash memory, a 64-Mbit serial Quad I/O Flash memory and a dedicated Power Management Unit.
The SAMA7G54 SOM limits design rules of the main application board, reducing overall PCB complexity and cost. 
The SAMA7G54 SOM family is supported by a free Linux® distribution and bare metal C examples.
